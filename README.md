# üåç COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that tracks and visualizes global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using Python. This project uses real-world datasets to uncover insights across countries and over time.

---

## ‚úÖ Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Compare metrics across countries or regions.
- Visualize trends with charts and maps.
- Communicate findings through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

---

## üõ† Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas** ‚Äì for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib** ‚Äì for data visualization.
- **seaborn** ‚Äì for statistical visualizations.
- **plotly** *(optional)* ‚Äì for interactive choropleth maps.
- **geopandas** *(optional)* ‚Äì for geospatial data mapping.

## üìÇ How to Run or View the Project

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Make sure you have the CSV dataset:  
   `owid-covid-data.csv` (from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)).
3. Place the CSV in your project folder (adjust the path in the notebook if needed).
4. Open `COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb` using:
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - VS Code with Jupyter extension
   - Google Colab (you may need to upload the CSV manually)
5. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visuals.

## üìä Key Insights & Reflections

- **Country Trends:** The United States had some of the highest peaks in daily cases and deaths, while India experienced a sharp second wave.
- **Vaccination Rollouts:** Some countries like the UK and Israel led early on with high vaccination rates.
- **Death Rate Trends:** Countries with better healthcare infrastructure tended to show lower death rates over time.
- **Visualization Power:** Using line charts, bar charts, and optional choropleth maps helped uncover patterns that would be difficult to see in raw data.

This project demonstrates the power of Python and open data in understanding global health crises through clear and compelling visual narratives.
